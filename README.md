Purpose: Create a movie information data frame in SQL that will allow users to quickly and conveniently do the following when looking for a movie:
 1. Compare movie ratings by release year.  What were the top 5 rated movies based on the combined data sets (ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and possibly user reviews)?
 2. Compare movie ratings by genre.  What were the top 5 rated movies based on the combined data sets (ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and possibly user reviews)?
 3. Target age group of movies (Top 5).  This will allow users to get movies that target their specific age group and interest users of the same age.   
 4. Inform the consumer where to stream a movie.
